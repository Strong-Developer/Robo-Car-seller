            <p class="text-justify font-weight-bold removable-line-break highlight-line-break">
                The ECONOMY is tough, and consumers have leveled up their tactics. While small-ticket items are
                bought immediately and on a regular basis, higher-end items sit idle in inventory for far too long.
                An outside-the-box approach is required to get these items sold. Coupons, discounts, auctions and sales all lose their meaning when consumers need to match the sellers minimum price. Many buyers want the gratification of knowing that they saved money by making a deal, and they are willing to delay purchases and look elsewhere to get that gratification.
                <br><br>
                On other hand, sellers and companies pay thousands of dollars for website traffic, yet statistically,
                90 - 97% of website visitors don't buy anything. Consumers look at the catalog and they walk
                away with empty shopping carts. With RoboNegotiator, consumers get the satisfaction of saving money
                by making special deals. And sellers B2B/B2C/eCommerce companies Again advantages as well.
